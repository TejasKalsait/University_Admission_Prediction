# University_Admission_Prediction

 This is my first Machine Learning Project
 
 I have train regression models to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile. This project could be practically used to get the university acceptance rate for individual students using web application. 
 
## The factors used to determine the chances are..
 1. GRE score (out of 340)
 2. TOEFL score (out of 120)
 3. University Rating (1 to 5)
 4. LOR rating (upto 5)
 5. SOP rating (upto 5)
 6. CGPA (out of 10)
 7. Research experience (0 or 1)
 
## Various Regression model built are..
 1. Linear Regression
    accuracy: 81.71%
 2. Artificial Neural Network
    accuracy: 74.05%
 3. Decision Tree
    accuracy: 51.30%
 4. Random Forest
      accuracy: 77.20%

The highest accuracy was obtained was 85% for the Linear Regression model

## various regression models KPIs
  1. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) = 5.85%
  2. MSE (Mean Squared Error) = 0.34%
  3. MAE (Mean Absolute Error) = 4.35%
  4. R2 ( R Squared) = 81.71%
  5. Adjusted R2 = 79.80%
